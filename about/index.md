<img src="https://opencarecc.github.io/ResQ/assets/ResQ-post-img-smartphone.jpg" alt="ResQ-Smartphone">

ResQ is a research project developed within the <b>[opencare Maker in Residence](http://wemake.cc/opencare/maker-in-residence-en/)</b>, as part of the <b>[opencare](opencare.cc)</b> European project - "Open Participatory Engagement in Collective Awareness for REdesign of Care Services”.

<b>opencare</b> is an open project, shared with a global community working together to make healthcare and social care accessible to everyone, through working with open-source logic and by promoting ways of enhancing active individual and community participation using a collective intelligence platform.

<blockquote><i><b>ResQ</b> is a research project on the <b>refugees</b> behave towards <b>mobile technology.</b></i></blockquote>

### Need or problem
The way helpful advices are addressed to refugees might not be that effective. We investigate the way they share information to provide them the best tool.

### Beneficiary
<b>Refugees and migrants</b> who need to be informed on <b>their rights</b> in foreign countries and willing to know more about them.

### Our solution
We conducted <b>focus groups</b> on the use of smartphones and their apps.

### ResQ

After the pivot, Doc.doc became <b>ResQ</b>, still a medical app. So we got the suggestion that maybe ResQ could organize any kind of legal docs, not just medical ones.

After few interviews, though, we realized that the use of smartphones we envisioned wasn’t consistent to the reality. From this point onwards we radically focused on a <b>deeper research.</b> [Read more...](https://opencarecc.github.io/ResQ/blog/2017/06/14/mir-application-resq/)
