<blockquote><i><b>ResQ</b> is a research project on the refugees behave towards mobile technology.
In particular we conduct <b>JAM</b> and focus groups on the use of smartphones and their apps.</i></blockquote>

Our research project continues, among the <b>opencare Residency</b> and our ambitions and dreams. But it is time now to open and share the ResQ challenge to a specific Milanese community, in order to frame the possible scenarios of the project and to gain more awareness about them.

Thus, we decided to organize the <b>#ResQJam</b> entitled <b>"SMART TRAVEL - let's MAKE it together"</b> in collaboration with [Naga Har](https://www.facebook.com/NagaOnlus/).  

A <b>co-design JAM</b> is like a music one, where many 'different musicians' play together, but applied to design. In particular they usually involve service design project.
In a JAM <b>everyone is involved</b> in the creative and designing process, and it’s crucial the participation of the people the service created will be address to.

The <b>research activity</b> is made of two steps:
1. A dedicated, very visual, <b>interview</b> to get which are the <b>most popular apps</b> among certain groups of refugees.
2. The co-design JAM consists in three main parts, in which the most important one is the <b>framing</b> of the research context through a <b>storytelling</b> method.
