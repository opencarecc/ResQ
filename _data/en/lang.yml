description: "<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
    <p>
      This website illustrates the experience and the progress of <b>ResQ</b> within the <b>opencare Maker in Residence</b>,
    which took place in WeMake from 12/06 to 25/06/2017.
    </p>
  <h2>Our core values</h2>
  <p>
    ResQ is a platform that allows users to live <b>social life experiences</b> in the city where they live, through an <b>exchange</b> of information and experiences,
    to have social literacy where technology is just the tool to sparkle positive dynamics with the host city, turing it into a '<b>Welcoming City</b>',
    thanks to the possibility of meeting with people who make themselves available, discovering new places and new local resources, matching interests, abilities and needs.
    <br><br>
    The service implements national and international dynamics, facilitating social hospitality, given by the different life experiences. 
  </p>"
