<blockquote><i>Doc.doc è la soluzione per mettere in contatto medici che seguono lo stesso paziente, fornendo loro la panoramica più completa possibile.</i></blockquote>

On 3rd of May 2017 we submitted our application to the <b>CALL FOR MAKERS - opencare Maker In Residence.</b>  

The <b>opencare Maker in Residence</b> is the first edition of a special residency program organized by [WeMake](wemake.cc), as part of the <b>opencare</b> European project. It provides support, assistance, funding and acceleration to Makers – from all over the world – who are interested in developing / validating / iterating an open source project in the health and care field.

We applied as <b>Doc.doc</b>, a <b>platform</b> which facilitates the communications between different physicians about the health state of a patient. More and more complex pathologies require a collaboration between different specialists.
