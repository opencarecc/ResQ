On 12th of June we started the <b>opencare Maker in Residence</b> at WeMake and thanks to the inspiring and helpful contributes from both the <b>online communities of EdgeRyders</b> and <b>offline research</b>, we as a team, decided to update our project from the original idea pivoting it to the far more impacting new usage context. We also changed our name project in <b>ResQ</b<.

Following is our updated project's abstract which includes some of the ideas mentioned in the previous comments.

<blockquote><i>ResQ is an app for physicians working in emergency contexts, that digitalise the health information of patients, so to make them easily available for colleagues.</i></blockquote>
