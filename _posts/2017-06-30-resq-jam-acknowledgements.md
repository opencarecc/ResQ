### Maker in Residence
We are here to share with you, after few days, the amazing residency we've lived at the <b>FabLab [WeMake](wemake.cc)</b> for the <b>european project [opencare](opencare.cc).</b>


### ResQ JAM
With <b>ResQ team</b> we've spent two weeks full of heat, work and satisfaction, at first we've investigated the dynamics and different <b>support services</b> for refugees in <b>City of Milan | Palazzo Marino</b>, realizing that we needed to talk directly to them, the protagonists.

Therefore, after few attempts, on Sunday we've managed to organize a <b>JAM "SMART TRAVEL - let's MAKE it together"</b> within the <b>[Naga Har](http://www.naga.it/index.php/centro-har.html)</b>, a welcoming place for asylum seekers, refugees and torture victims. Our lab has raised awareness and interested, and has allowed us to have a direct interaction, trying to find together the solutions to different needs. Now we are elaborating answers and we'll keep you updated about the results; in meanwhile <b>THANK YOU</b> to all those people that we've met because they have been fundamental for our growth!
