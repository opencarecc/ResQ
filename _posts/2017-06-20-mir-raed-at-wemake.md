During the first week of the <b>opencare MIR</b>, we get in contact with different associations and we met a lot of interesting people.

Through this post, we want to present you <b>Raed Kassem</b>, who will be part of the ResQ team! We are more than happy to <b>welcome</b> Raed in our research group!

Raed works and collaborates everyday with <b>refugees and migrants in Milan.</b> We have been really lucky to meet him.
Therefore, on 20th of June, he came at WeMake to discuss together about the <b>organization of the event</b> that we want to promote to <b>[Naga](http://www.naga.it/)</b> in order to analyze and conduct the user research of <b>ResQ project.</b>

<blockquote><i>Il Naga è un'associazione di volontariato laica e apartitica che si è costituita a Milano nel 1987 allo scopo di promuovere e di tutelare i diritti di tutti i cittadini stranieri, rom e sinti senza discriminazione alcuna. Il naga è una onlus iscritta ai registri del volontariato.</i></blockquote>

Raed and the tutors of the <b>opencare</b> team gave us a lot of insights which were useful to build up the event that we named "SMART TRAVEL - let's MAKE it together", a <b>co-design JAM</b>, and its tools and activities.
