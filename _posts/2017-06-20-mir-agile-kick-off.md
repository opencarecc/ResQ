Together with Chiara and Silvia, from the WeMake - OpenCare MIR team, we explored the main steps of the <b>Agile Planning</b>, which made us able to focus more on our project ResQ.

For those who are not familiar with this methodology, Agile is an effective way of working that helps teams in identifying their unique value proposition, and how to make it real.

Therefore we went through the following steps:

1. Why are we here
2. The elevator pitch
3. The product box
4. The Not list
5. Meet your neighbours
6. What keep us up at night
7. Size it up

<blockquote><i>ResQ is an app for physicians working in emergency contexts, that digitalise the health information of patients, so to make them easily available for colleagues.</i></blockquote>
