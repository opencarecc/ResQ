During last two weeks that we've spent at WeMake our team's path has been very productive and intense. All the activities we've carried out have brought us to improve and establish a focus for our project.
Our project started during the course of UX-UI where we were asked to find a solution to a care need / issue.

Our proposal in this field was an <b>app</b>, 'Doc.Doc', to facilitate the B2B relationship between doctors within the patients' care path, especially with serious conditions, where communication between physicians is fundamental.

In particular we conducted <b>focus groups</b> on the use of smartphones and their apps.</i></blockquote>
